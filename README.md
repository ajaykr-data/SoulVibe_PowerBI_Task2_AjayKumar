# 📊 Power BI Dashboard – Education Dataset Analysis

This is a Power BI project I completed as part of my internship at Soulvibe.Tech (Batch 10).  
It involves cleaning, transforming, and visualizing an educational dataset of 60,000+ records using Power BI.

Done in Power Query Editor (Power BI Desktop):
- Removed missing values in `College Type`
- Renamed columns for clarity
- Created `Specialization` column from `Course Name`
- Created `Duration Category` field based on months:
  - Short (<12)
  - Medium (12–36)
  - Long (>36)
